                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This project is my attempt to build a Pomodoro-style focus app that helps users manage tasks, breaks, and motivation. I conducted research on 5 popular productivity apps, analyzing features, usability, and user sentiment using Python scripts. The insights from this research shaped the design and functionality of my app.</p>

                <h2>Key Insights</h2>
                <p>From analyzing user reviews, I discovered that simplicity is key. Users love clean, easy-to-use interfaces and the ability to customize their experience. Gamification elements are appreciated but must be balanced so they don’t overshadow the main goal: productivity. Finally, stability and minimal bugs are absolute deal breakers—so performance is a top priority.</p>

                <h2>User Tasks & Goals</h2>
                <p>The app allows users to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start and stop focused work sessions (Pomodoro cycles) with adjustable timers.</li>
                    <li>Manage tasks and subtasks to break work into manageable pieces.</li>
                    <li>Receive motivational feedback, like extra break time or visual rewards for completing tasks.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Target Users</h2>
                <p>My app is designed for students, freelancers, or anyone looking to balance work and breaks effectively. The goal is to require minimal onboarding with an intuitive, straightforward UI, while giving users enough customization to feel in control of their workflow.</p>

                <h2>Design & Functionality</h2>
                <p>The main interface is clean and minimal, with a central Start/Break button and optional second window for tasks. Users can customize break times, work-to-break ratios, and even see progress visually through gamification elements like growing trees. Everything is built to run smoothly in the background, with minimal resource usage, and work offline on mobile devices.</p>

                <h2>Data & Storage</h2>
                <p>All user data—including tasks, subtasks, due dates, and timer preferences—is stored locally for offline access. JSON or SQLite ensures quick access and reliable storage.</p>

                <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
                <p>My goal with this app is not just to provide a tool but to create an experience that encourages focus, rewards progress, and reduces distractions. Every decision—from UI design to performance optimization—is informed by real user feedback and data analysis.</p>
