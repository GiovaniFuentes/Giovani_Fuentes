								<h2>Early Curiosity lolll</h2>
								<p>Howdy! My name is Giovani Fuentes, but everyone calls me Gio. I’m a senior Computer Science major with an emphasis in cybersecurity at New Mexico State University, graduating in May 2026. My passion for technology started back in middle school when I was curious about how YouTubers made their own websites. I looked up a simple HTML tutorial and typed out <code>&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;</code> Seeing those two words appear on screen for the first time I know it may sound cliche, but it was something special. It sparked a curiosity that’s stuck with me ever since.</p>
								<h2>High School Exploration</h2>
								<p>In high school, I took every computer science class I could find Python, Java, even a cybersecurity class that introduced me to system vulnerabilities and defense. I joined competitions like CyberPatriot, where I worked with NJROTC and other students to secure Windows Server images. I also helped create an app idea for the Samsung Solve for Tomorrow competition, focused on promoting recycling in schools, where our team reached the semi-final state stage. Those experiences taught me that I love both problem-solving and collaboration—two things that continue to guide me today.</p>
								<h2>College Journey</h2>	
								<p>At NMSU, I’ve continued to grow both technically and personally. I currently work as a Student IT Technician, where I help keep hundreds of computers and systems running smoothly. There’s something deeply rewarding about helping a user solve a technical problem and seeing their appreciation—it reminds me that technology should help people, not frustrate them.<br><br>

									Beyond that, I’ve been a founding member and Vice President of the NMSU Cybersecurity Club, where we compete in events like CCDC, CTFs, and the National Cyber League, earning several platinum and diamond badges. These competitions push me to learn more every day and strengthen my technical and teamwork skills.<br><br>
									
									Outside of academics, I’ve also been part of the NMSU Marching Band, serving as section captain for the sousaphones. Music has been a huge part of my life, teaching me discipline, rhythm, and leadership.</p>
								<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>		
								<p>After I graduate, I plan to continue building my skills in cybersecurity. I’m currently working toward certifications like CompTIA Security+ and GitHub Foundations through LinkedIn Learning. I’m still exploring whether I’ll go straight into the workforce, pursue my master’s degree, or do both—but whichever path I take, my goal is to make my work meaningful and impactful. I truly believe learning never stops, and there’s always room to improve, no matter where you are in your journey.</p>	
								<h2>Beyond Tech</h2>
								<p>When I’m not working or studying, I love spending time with family and friends. Music is a big part of my life—I listen to a mix of everything from Joji and Cuco to Banda MS, Hozier, BTS, BlackPink, and Sabrina Carpenter (my playlists are definitely all over the place).<br><br>

									I’m also a fan of video games like Minecraft and Valorant, and I spend a lot of time watching YouTube video essays and long form content about tech, media, and storytelling. Some of my favorite shows are Supernatural, House, The Office, and various anime like One Punch Man, Mob Psycho 100, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Your Lie in April.<br><br>
									
									At the heart of it all, I value collaboration, curiosity, and empathy. I believe in listening to people’s perspectives,even when we disagree because at the end of the day, it’s important to remember the human behind every idea.</p>
