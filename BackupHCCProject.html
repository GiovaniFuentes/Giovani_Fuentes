                <h1><strong>THE IDEA</strong></h1>
                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This project is my attempt to build a Pomodoro-style focus app that helps users manage tasks, breaks, and motivation. I conducted research on 5 popular productivity apps, analyzing features, usability, and user sentiment using Python scripts. The insights from this research shaped the design and functionality of my app.</p>

                <h2>Key Insights</h2>
                <p>From analyzing user reviews, I discovered that simplicity is key. Users love clean, easy-to-use interfaces and the ability to customize their experience. Gamification elements are appreciated but must be balanced so they don’t overshadow the main goal: productivity. Finally, stability and minimal bugs are absolute deal breakers—so performance is a top priority.</p>

                <h2>User Tasks & Goals</h2>
                <p>The app allows users to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start and stop focused work sessions (Pomodoro cycles) with adjustable timers.</li>
                    <li>Manage tasks and subtasks to break work into manageable pieces.</li>
                    <li>Receive motivational feedback, like extra break time or visual rewards for completing tasks.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Target Users</h2>
                <p>My app is designed for students, freelancers, or anyone looking to balance work and breaks effectively. The goal is to require minimal onboarding with an intuitive, straightforward UI, while giving users enough customization to feel in control of their workflow.</p>

                <h2>Design & Functionality</h2>
                <p>The main interface is clean and minimal, with a central Start/Break button and optional second window for tasks. Users can customize break times, work-to-break ratios, and even see progress visually through gamification elements like growing trees. Everything is built to run smoothly in the background, with minimal resource usage, and work offline on mobile devices.</p>

                <h2>Data & Storage</h2>
                <p>All user data—including tasks, subtasks, due dates, and timer preferences—is stored locally for offline access. JSON or SQLite ensures quick access and reliable storage.</p>

                <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
                <p>My goal with this app is not just to provide a tool but to create an experience that encourages focus, rewards progress, and reduces distractions. Every decision—from UI design to performance optimization—is informed by real user feedback and data analysis.</p>

                <h1><strong>The Process...</strong></h1>

                <h2>The Initial Prototype</h2>
                <div class="box alt">
                    <div class="row gtr-uniform">
                        <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/InitialProto/20251026_232549.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                        <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/InitialProto/20251026_232556.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                        <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/InitialProto/20251026_232605.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>We started by sketching and designing a low-fidelity prototype focused on the core idea: a flexible Pomodoro-style timer that visually represents focus and rest. At this stage, the goal was not functionality, but understanding layout, hierarchy, and how users would interpret the interface at a glance.</p>
                <p>This initial prototype used a large radial timer as the central interaction point, with minimal text and clear visual emphasis. We intentionally avoided feature overload so we could test whether users understood the app’s purpose without instructions.</p>
                    

                <h2>Lofidelity Prototypes</h2>
                <p>We created two low-fidelity prototypes using a “Wizard of Oz” approach, meaning the designs were interactive only in concept. Users were asked to imagine functionality while we observed how they navigated each interface and interpreted its controls/p>
                    <h3>Prototype 1</h3>
                        <div class="box alt">
                            <div class="row gtr-uniform">
                                <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ProtoOne/Proto1.1.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                                <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ProtoOne/Proto1.2.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                                <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ProtoOne/Proto1.3.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    <p>Prototype 1 focused on simplicity. The main screen featured a large circular (radial) timer with minimal text and a clear work/break toggle. This design emphasized immediate usability, allowing users to quickly understand how to start focusing without feeling overwhelmed.</p>
                    <p>User testing showed that participants found this version easier to understand and less intimidating. Even users unfamiliar with the Pomodoro technique gravitated toward the large circular timer and felt more confident interacting with it.</p>
                    <h3>Prototype 2</h3>
                        <div class="box alt">
                            <div class="row gtr-uniform">
                                <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ProtoTwo/Proto2.1.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                                <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ProtoTwo/Proto2.2.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                                <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ProtoTwo/Proto2.3.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                                <div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/ProtoTwo/Proto2.4.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>                                
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    <p>Prototype 2 expanded on functionality by introducing more text, task completion controls, and a rectangular timer design. This version allowed users to complete both main tasks and subtasks, earning additional break time as motivation.</p>
                    <p>While users appreciated the added information and organizational tools, feedback indicated that this prototype felt more cluttered. Some participants found it harder to quickly understand what actions to take, especially without guidance or visual feedback such as animations or sound.</p>
                
                <h2>User Research & Evaluation</h2>
                <p>We evaluated both prototypes by observing participants as they interacted with each design and then asking follow-up questions. Participants were asked about clarity, ease of navigation, and how motivating or overwhelming the interface felt.</p>
                <p>Common feedback highlighted the importance of clear visual cues and immediate understanding. One participant noted, “I didn’t understand what the buttons were—I was just pressing them,” which reinforced the need for clearer labels and better onboarding.</p>
                
                <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Prototype 1 was preferred overall due to its simplicity and clear visual focus.</li>
                    <li>Prototype 2 offered useful features but felt too cluttered for quick interaction.</li>
                    <li>Users wanted more customization options, especially for colors and timer behavior.</li>
                    <li>Participants wanted better feedback through sound, animation, or visual rewards.</li>
                    <li>Not all users were familiar with the Pomodoro technique, indicating the need for a short tutorial.</li>
                </ul>
